to do:

lightbox possibility: http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/guide
fix criteria for top rated so only things with (say) 5 or more ratings qualify




fixed:
admin can't delete others' dreams
comment ajax isn't working
set up mailers (i.e. for forgotten password)
remove "search tk"
fix "rated by" list -- move to controller, fix one or many, link usernames

To publish to heroku:

git push heroku-cedar master (don't forget to heroku run rake db:migrate --app dreamerist !)
